- as a child he once broke up with Madame Pallponia (his first love and our group's fully adult dance instructor) during Armasse Week.

## Adult life
- The boy has grown up!! 
- Hair: blue base with a green top
> 	Open hearts, closed fist
- has a neck / shoulder tattoo and he doesn't know what it says / means.  (weird dwarvish or elvish script)
- Feels like the weight of nobility is a heavy burden
