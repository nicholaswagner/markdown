# Courtyard near the water-feature
Princess Eutropia Stavian is giving a speech:

_Rhenquist Merosett, Arturo Basri, and Caritas Zespire notice a female servant with a purple brick.  Rhen and Arturo corners the girl and takes the brick (its magic - will upset a bunch of bees in the apiary), she claims a guard gave it to her and asked her to place it in the apiary._..   

_Unaware of this, Princess Eutropia Stavian continues her speech_
> ... Tonight we revisit primogeniture ... *cheering / clapping / raised glasses ...*


# _The group heads off into different areas to pursue their various tasks_ 

Zarissa Nocturne observes some things:
- _High Strategos Pytharious has the only non-peacebound weapon_
- some other stuff, but i missed it

Allister Hound 
- speaks with Countess Abrielle Pace
- other stuff but i missed it

Caritas Zespire speaks with Baron Nicolaus Okerra and attempts to persuade him to support primogeniture for women (not successful)
- influence diplomacy check DC is 21 (i think)

[discovers the following about the baron]:  
- Selly - daughter of Baron Nicolaus Okerra, (mother passed, Selly wants to be a knight and the baron has reluctantly agreed to help her achieve this goal)

Arturo Basri speaks with Copernia Valle who gives him a superb repair kit 

Rhenquist Merosett in the Imperial Archives:
-  spots Count Orlundo Zespire, Viscountess Nicodemus, Grand Duke Avernathus, and Duke Leonard Centimus
- Speaks with Duke Leonard Centimus
	- uses a wheelchair of his own design 
	- (fell from a horse and his legs no longer work)
	- says shipping is difficult, pirates, logistics are plagued by rats (both people and animal kind)
	- the duchess clement's wheelchair is based on his design

Viscountess Tirri Kastner-Caleo heads to the Imperial Archives, attempts to persuade the room (unsuccessful check no one around atm is interested in her nature stuff)

---

Allister Hound
- meets Duke Leonard Centimus, fangirls over the Duke's artifice abilities, Duke seems receptive and thankful for the praise

meanwhile Caritas Zespire impresses the current senate floor re: Glorian Lore
- rolled a 23 on his diplomacy check ( critical success )
- is approached by Baronette Dexterious who is wearing a gold ring. 
- slips off a gold ring and hands it to Carit, family signet - ring worth 130sp
- diplomacy is now available to influence every room

Arturo Basri is in the arcade in a separate back room
- makes a check, rolled a nat 20, critically succeeded
- speaks with Earl Vern..ant who is a direct descendant of general arnisant, he is one of his direct descendants 

Rhenquist Merosett makes his way up to the gallery
- friendly banter with grand dutch Heskillar by giving anecdotes involving Zarissa Nocturne (the dutchess's servant)
- Rhen gives a fabulous curtsey to the dutchess on request ;)
- Heskillar regrets not inviting Rhen to her ball yesterday, she did not know he was in town, but the Princess Eutropia Stavian attended
- Countess Abrielle Pace introduces herself to Rhen - to influence, use fashion lore, intimidate, and diplomacy, she is a huge gossip, cares about money and reputation

Viscountess Tirri Kastner-Caleo wanders into the gallery looking for alcohol
performance, deception, thievery, diplomacy - she impresses, but its still not enough to win the room

Zarissa Nocturne sneaks off to take the potion, and sneaks into the Arcade
- rolls a 15 which is the DC!

---

Allister Hound in the archives, continues to speak with Centimus.
- Centimus seems anti-Eutropia in this conversation
- rolls nat 1, is not a success 

Caritas Zespire speaks again to the Baron Okerra
- extends an invitation to spar with his 10 year old daughter Selly which the Baron seems to enjoy and loathe at the same time
- ** rolls to influence him via diplomacy, success!

Arturo Basri places the purple brick out in the open and stakes it out to see who attempts to collect it
- sees a portly young man who very smoothly and subtly scoops the brick
- follows him out the arcade into the senate floor
- the brick is handed off again and again to different people (ITS A CONSPIRACY)

Rhenquist Merosett is speaking with Countess Abrielle Pace 
- Rhen mocks someone's fashion and it lands well with Abrielle
- Reminds her of the Glorious beginning of the Empire, and attempts to influence her

Viscountess Tirri Kastner-Caleo continues dancing in the gallery
- makes some minor inroads but the gallery is still not impressed by us

---
Martella Lotheed chimes in and invites us all to a secluded private conference room
- she once again activates the mechanical cricket which begins to make soft chirping sounds as we sync up
- wants us to meet with Senater Amadorian Dou.
- senator Trant, or rather his daughter who is a bully, narcissistic, and a cunt.  Dame Malpheme Trant.  Is probably here to bully someone to take her father's position. (to vote against)
- wants us to pass a letter to Count Orlundo
- has an actual size tiny mechanical cricket which she passes to the group. The Brass Chatterbox
- we discover that Princess Eutropia Stavian does not know of our involvement
