 _Human Fighter / Young Reformer / Affluent and Carefree Playboy._ 
 
 Lord Caritas of House Zespire is perceived as a charming and somewhat irresponsible nobleman. Known for his affable nature, he frequently mingles with the city's elite and maintains a prominent public profile. Often seen in the company of beautiful women, his reputation as a playboy is well-established. 
 
 Though he appears aloof and unconcerned with serious matters, Caritas is deeply passionate about three things: wine, women, and warring—specifically, dueling. 
 
 While others may assume he wastes his time in frivolous pursuits, Caritas has dedicated countless hours to mastering the blade.
