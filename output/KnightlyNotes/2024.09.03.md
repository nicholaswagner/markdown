note:   GPS - Likes stories and narrative, allegories will increase patience by 1, flattery rolls are treated as 1 degree higher, 
baiting or logic causes him to lose patience

	THE BATTLE "ROYALE"

- Zarissa - Rhetoric play -> (failed)
- Arturo - Flattery of Stavian : "your children are amazing fighters!"
- Allister:  "despite our efforts". Bartleby picked up a wand

- Caritas tries to make a bad allegory comparing the Merosett's to Cheliax tactics ... its a mess.  He's seven.  Its not well formed and falls flat.
- Tirri - used emotional appeal - its super effective
- Zarissa -> society / flattery -> 21!! GPS -> approves
- we win the argument!

- Stavian 3 :  "Next time, no children"
- everyone exits the room except the count and bartlebee, as we leave the room you see the count pick up a walking stick.  Sounds of screaming and loud cracks

- the children are collected later that evening by prince carrius. (Zarissa leaves her sister Velki in the drawer and notifies a nearby servant)

- the princess gives the party flower crowns that she made for us. 

- once alone, zarissa spots her mom walking into the woods.  where she steps the earth begins to decay in her footsteps.

- slips caritas's ceremonial dagger into marsella's kit with a note.  "i will make this world better for people like you."
